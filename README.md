### Disclaimer: This project is not a part of Fluent Steam dev team. It's a user-made application. As for now, this program is flagged by Windows Defender. You can look in the code and find proof that it does nothing malicious, but if you are still suspicious, its understandable. Just download the original archives and install it the old way
