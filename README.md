 This program is a "Fluent Steam Skin" launcher for easier installation process. Install a Fluent Steam skin by simply choosing what options do you want and clicking "Install". Its THAT simple. All the files used here are the same as the Fluent for Steam public release that can be found in Discord Server.
 
## Support
You can donate to the LynxarADev to get code snippets, personal code thoughts or just to support: [Boosty Subscription Link](https://boosty.to/lynxaradev/).
It will definitely motivate me to do more coding in my free time. Don't worry, this project will be free and open source anyway (unless Fluent For Steam devs remove the free version)

## Official links:

## SFP Patch
For extra skins like custom Library and Dark Friends List you need to Patch your Steam. To do it, download the latest version of Steam Friends Patcher from the link above. Click **Patch** inside this app and wait for it to finish the patching process. After that, you can check the "I've already patched SFP" checkbox and install Extras.
 
### Disclaimer: This project is not a part of Fluent Steam dev team. It's a user-made application. As for now, this program is flagged by Windows Defender. You can look in the code and find proof that it does nothing malicious, but if you are still suspicious, its understandable. Just download the original archives and install it the old way
